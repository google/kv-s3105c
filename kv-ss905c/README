The KV-SS905C[1] scanner (and family) are industrial bulk document scanners. They
have a document feed and can scan hundreds of pages at high speed without
manual aid.

Although some newer models have USB interfaces, this userspace driver uses the
generic SCSI layer of the Linux kernel to work with their SCSI interface. It
was written based on an NDAed document (not included) and released with
Panasonic's blessing.
